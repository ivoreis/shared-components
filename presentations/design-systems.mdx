# Design Systems

---

## Problems

- Visibility across the group/company
- Consistency across the group/company
- Source of truth (Design + Development)

---

## Hypothesis

- Design team adopted Figma as the main design platform
- Figma is the source of truth regarding group/company brand guidelines and design system
- Development team should be aware of what colours, spacing, typography to use without doubt
- These design tokens should be easily accessible for web, mobile or any other medium


How can we automate this Design -> Development step?

## Figma Automation Example

---

## Tokens + Themes

Design token system in place would help:

- Create brand agnostic components (Reusability)
- Unify brands and different platforms

This wouldn't be a perfect solution but it would be a step towards having consistency and awareness across the group/company

---

## What does this mean?

This would imply more consistency and organisation:
- follow name conventions (page, components, frames, layers)
- use known grouping formats
- master components
- styles
- ...
